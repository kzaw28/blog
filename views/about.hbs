            <p>
                I'm a 2nd-year computer programming student and an aspiring web developer. With 3 years of social media marketing and 
                graphic design experience as my background, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. Recently, I pivoted
                my career from digital marketing to computer programming due to my passion for web development and UI/UX design.
